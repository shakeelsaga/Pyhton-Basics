# Python Basics – Learning Repository

Welcome to my Python Basics repository! This repo is part of my personal learning journey where I’m building a strong foundation in Python through daily coding practice and mini projects.

Each script here explores a different fundamental concept — from loops and conditionals to file handling and recursion — all tied to real-world, terminal-based use cases. This work is part of **Week 1** in my RPA + AI Developer Roadmap.

## What's Inside

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `CollatzSequence.py` | Calculates the Collatz sequence for a given positive integer using recursion. User can enter new numbers, type 'help', or quit. |
| `CountDown.py` | Countdown timer that accepts minutes and seconds as input and updates in real-time until finished. |
| `GuessingGame.py` | A number guessing game where the user gets 3 tries to guess a randomly selected number between 1 and 20. |
| `IntroGenerator.py` | Prompts user for name, age, city, and hobby, then prints a generated introduction sentence. |
| `PasswordChecker.py` | Evaluates password strength based on rules and asks for confirmation. Repeats until a strong password is confirmed. |
| `ShoppingList.py` | CLI app to manage a grocery list. Users can add/remove items, view the list, and exit at any time. |
| `WordCounter.py` | Reads a user-specified text file and displays the total word count. Handles file-not-found errors cleanly. |
| `Calculator.py` | Accepts basic arithmetic expressions (+, -, *, /, %) from the user, evaluates them, and displays the result. Loops until user exits. |

## How to Run

Make sure you have Python 3 installed.

To run any script:

```bash
python3 filename.py
```

Example:

```bash
python3 CountDown.py
```
